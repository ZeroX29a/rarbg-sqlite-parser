- **Resizable Columns:** Dynamically adjusts column widths to optimize viewing experience across different screen resolutions.

### Enhanced User Experience

- **Initial Data Limit:** Limits the initial display to 50 items when the search field is empty, improving application responsiveness during launch.
- **Interactive Features:** Supports double-click actions to copy magnet links and direct IMDb links for more information.
- **Clipboard Integration:** Facilitates easy copying of magnet links to the clipboard with notifications for user feedback.

### Robust Error Handling

The application incorporates robust error handling mechanisms:
- **Error Messages:** Displays informative error messages using `messagebox.showerror` in case of database connection failures or invalid selections, guiding users effectively.

### Performance Optimization

- **Fuzzy Search:** Utilizes `fuzzy_search` function to efficiently retrieve search results, ensuring prompt display of relevant data even with partial search queries.
